# Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics in Cloud Environments

### Instructor: Gonzalo De La Torre Parra

### Workshop Attendance: UTSA Students and Faculty Members

## Course Materials:
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/utsabigdata/ml_and_big_data_in_cloud_environmnets)

#### Summary: This 3 hour work shop will cover introductory topics such as introduction to data analytics in the cloud, distributed data repositories, deploying your own data analytics and machine learning environment, deriving structure from unstructured data, querying and filtering your data, data visualization, and machine learning.

## Topics

* Introduction to Chameleon Cloud and Data Analytics

In this section we will introduce students and faculty members to Chameleon Cloud, an NSF-funded testbed system for Computer Science experimentation. It is designed to be deeply reconfigurable, with a wide variety of capabilities for researching systems, networking, distributed and cluster computing and security. In addition, we will introduce students to big data concepts and data pre-processing techniques that can be used in the cloud hosted environments. Furthermore, we introduce the audience to distributed data repositories providing details about how data is stored across multiple nodes, how data is indexed, and how data is retrieved using queries.

* Deploying your own Monitoring Environment and Connecting to a Data Analytics and Machine Learning Environment

In this section, we provide a guided hands-on tutorial in which each attendee will have the opportunity to create its own monitoring environment using light-weight shippers and connect to a Big Data and Machine Learning environment in the cloud. The students will learn to deploy light-weight data collectors, the function of each collector, and their proper usage and configuration. Some of the tools we cover in this section are: elasticsearch, kibana, logstash, beats, kibana, and X-Pack for machine learning.

* Deriving Structure from Unstructured Data, Querying and Retrieving Data

In this section, we present students with various approaches they can use to derive structure from unstructured data. The students will be guided through hands-on exercises in which they will be generating rules for pre-processing data obtained from different data shippers. In addition, the students will learn how to upload their own data through the API and Python libraries. In addition, students will learn how to make queries to their data repository using Kibana's dashboard and Python's elasticsearch-dsl library. Each student will learn how to use Python libraries to query, store data in JSON and Pandas data frames, and manipulate data in both formats for further processing.

* Data Visualization and Machine Learning

This section covers the usage of Kibana's visualization tools. The students will learn how to use raw and pre-processed data to generate informative graphics using different tools within Kibana such as Canvas. In addition, students will be given a brief introduction on how to use X-pack's machine learning module. Each student will have the opportunity to train their model, visualize anomalies, and set alarms when an anomaly is detected.
